# Gene Expression Signatures of Hepatocellular Carcinoma Circulating Tumor Cells vary with Site of Dissemination

## Abstract:
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the main subtype of liver cancer, which leads to high mortality worldwide. One of the obstacles to combating it is hematogenous dissemination, namely the major route of HCC metastasis. Multiple researches have revealed that circulating tumor cells (CTC) play an important role in HCC metastasis. Therefore, the underlying mechanisms are urgently needed to improve the patientsâ€™ cure rate and living quality. 

Here we obtained a gene expression dataset from a published study. The dataset contains transcriptomic information of 113 single circulating tumor cells (CTC) from 4 different vascular sites, including the hepatic vein (HV), peripheral artery (PA), peripheral vein (PV), and portal vein (PoV).

The gist of this project is to find the genes differentially expressed along with the metastasis pathway and interrogate their function which equips CTC capability to overcome the complex microenvironment and finally colonize successfully.

## Code discription: 
Methods to identify the genes differentially expressed in tumor cells among four vascular sites. The significant are identified using decision tree, random forest, XGBoost, and SVM with RFECV.
